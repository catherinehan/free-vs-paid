# Overview

## App pairs

`corpus-pairs.txt` contains the final corpus of Android app pairs in the following format:
```
<free-version-apk-name>,<paid-version-apk-name>
```

`popular-pairs.txt` contains the subset of the corpus where the paid app had at
least 500,000 installations, according to its Play Store listing. It follows
the same format as `corpus-pairs.txt`.

## Play Store pages

This repository also includes full-page archival copies of the Play Store
listings for two apps we mention in our analysis of the most downloaded
paid apps: `me.dreamsky.leagueofstickmanzombie` and
`se.magicinteractive.rumble`. These archival copies were taken on
February 13, 2020.
